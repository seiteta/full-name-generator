# name-generator
A python script that generates random full names.

A csv file containing first and last names and their relative frequency is required. In this repo, `names.csv` cointains 500 very common French names.

Last names are from [here](http://www.genealogie.com/nom-de-famille/classement-general-0-1) and first names from [here](http://www.rrq.gouv.qc.ca/interactif/pr2i121_prenoms/pr2i121_prenoms/PR2SPrenoms_01.aspx)
